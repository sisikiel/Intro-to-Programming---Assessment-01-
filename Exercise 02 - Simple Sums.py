#In this second exercise, adding simple sums are the tasks that needs to be done.

#start the code by declaring the two variables that contains two numerical values.
number1 = 8
number2 = 10

#declare another variable to store the results.
sum = number1 + number2
print(f"The total sum of {number1} and {number2} is {sum}!")

#To print out the result I simply used the f string to make the line of code a lot easier to read.
#Using braces, { }, is necessary to display the actual value inside the variable.
